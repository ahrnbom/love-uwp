# love-uwp
A VS2015 project that lets your build Löve for Windows 10 UWP apps.

If you just want to make awesome games with Löve targeting UWP, go use https://github.com/ahrnbom/l-veftw instead. This repository is separate just in case Löve developers want to integrate these fixes into "mainstream" Löve.
